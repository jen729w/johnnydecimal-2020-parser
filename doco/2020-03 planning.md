# First task: build the state machine

It should take input and return either
`{ result: true }`
if the input is valid, or
`{ result: false, error: 'error message here' }`
otherwise.

- Just feed it a variable for now. Don't worry about how this happens at all.
- This is all about the **state machine**. That's it.
- Nail the state machine and the documentation of the spec.
- That is the goal, and the only goal. Do not get distracted.
